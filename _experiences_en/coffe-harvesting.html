# Coffee Harvesting Experience

Discover the authentic world of Colombian coffee with our immersive harvesting experience in the highlands of Huila. This hands-on adventure takes you through the entire coffee production process, from picking the ripe cherries to savoring a freshly brewed cup made from beans you helped harvest.

## The Heart of Colombian Coffee

The Huila region is renowned worldwide for producing some of Colombia's finest coffee. The unique combination of high altitude, fertile volcanic soil, and ideal climate conditions creates the perfect environment for growing exceptional coffee beans with distinctive flavor profiles characterized by bright acidity, medium body, and notes of caramel, chocolate, and tropical fruits.

Our experience takes place at La Llanara Farm, a family-owned coffee plantation that has been producing specialty coffee for generations. Located near San Agustín, the farm offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains while maintaining traditional and sustainable farming practices.

## Your Coffee Journey

### The Coffee Plant

Your experience begins with an introduction to coffee cultivation. Learn about the coffee plant's life cycle, the importance of shade trees in coffee ecosystems, and how environmental factors influence bean quality. You'll walk through lush rows of coffee trees while your guide explains the careful attention required to grow premium coffee.

### Harvesting Experience

Roll up your sleeves and join local coffee pickers to harvest ripe coffee cherries. Learn how to identify perfectly ripe fruit by color and texture, and the selective picking techniques that ensure only the highest quality cherries are collected. This hands-on activity gives you a genuine appreciation for the skill and efficiency of experienced coffee pickers.

### Processing Workshop

After harvesting, dive into the processing stage. Witness and participate in:
- **Pulping:** Removing the outer fruit to reveal the beans
- **Fermentation:** Understanding how this crucial step develops flavor
- **Washing:** Cleaning the beans to remove any remaining fruit
- **Drying:** Learning different drying methods and their impact on flavor

### From Roasting to Brewing

Experience the transformation of green coffee beans through the roasting process, which brings out the complex flavors and aromas. Then, participate in a brewing workshop where you'll learn various preparation methods including:
- Traditional Colombian brewing with a cloth filter
- Modern pour-over techniques
- French press brewing
- Espresso preparation (demonstration)

### Cupping Session

The journey concludes with a professional cupping session where you'll learn to identify different flavor notes, acidity levels, body, and overall quality. This sensory experience helps you understand how coffee professionals evaluate beans and how terroir influences taste profiles.

## Conservation and Sustainability

Throughout the experience, you'll learn about the farm's commitment to sustainable practices, including:
- Organic farming methods
- Water conservation techniques
- Biodiversity preservation
- Fair labor practices
- Climate change adaptation strategies

Our partner farm is Rainforest Alliance certified, ensuring their operations meet rigorous environmental, social, and economic sustainability standards.

## Take Home More Than Memories

At the end of your coffee journey, you'll receive a package of fresh coffee from the very farm you visited—a delicious souvenir that allows you to share your Colombian coffee experience with friends and family back home.

Whether you're a coffee connoisseur or simply curious about the origins of your morning brew, this authentic experience provides a deeper connection to one of Colombia's most important cultural and agricultural treasures.
