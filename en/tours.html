    <h2>Real Traveler Stories</h2>
    <p>"We expected beautiful landscapes and interesting history, but what we found in Huila was so much more. Our guide didn't just show us places - he introduced us to people, traditions, and a way of life. Sharing coffee with a fourth-generation farmer, learning ancestral cooking techniques, and watching the sunset in the Tatacoa Desert with local astronomers were experiences we'll treasure forever. Colombia Travels didn't give us a tour - they gave us memories that will last a lifetime."</p>
