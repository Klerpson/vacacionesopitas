# 10 Must-See Hidden Gems in Huila, Colombia

While Huila is home to the world-famous Tatacoa Desert and the UNESCO-recognized San Agustín Archaeological Park, this diverse Colombian department has so much more to offer curious travelers willing to venture beyond the usual tourist trail. As a Huila native who has spent years exploring my home region, I'm excited to share these lesser-known treasures that showcase the true heart and soul of this magnificent area.

## 1. Termales de Rivera: Nature's Thermal Spa

Just an hour's drive from Neiva, the Termales de Rivera offers a natural spa experience that most international tourists miss. These hot springs are nestled in lush vegetation with multiple pools of varying temperatures, some reaching up to 40°C (104°F). The mineral-rich waters are said to have therapeutic properties, and there's nothing quite like soaking in these steaming pools while surrounded by the verdant Colombian countryside.

**Local tip:** Visit on weekdays to avoid crowds and arrive early to watch the morning mist rise off the thermal waters.

## 2. La Jagua: Colombia's Artisan Pottery Village

This small town 30 minutes from Garzón has been producing exceptional clay pottery for generations using techniques passed down through families for centuries. The town's artisans use locally sourced clay and natural pigments to create distinctive red-hued ceramics that are prized throughout Colombia. Many workshops welcome visitors, allowing you to try your hand at this ancient craft and purchase unique, handmade souvenirs directly from the artisans.

**Local tip:** Visit Doña Carmen's workshop, where this master potter has been creating masterpieces for over 50 years.

## 3. Cascada El Salto del Mortiño

This spectacular 70-meter waterfall near Isnos remains relatively undiscovered by international travelers. A moderate 45-minute hike through coffee plantations and cloud forest leads to this thundering cascade that plunges into a natural swimming pool. The surrounding area is a haven for birdwatchers, with numerous endemic species flitting through the forest canopy.

**Local tip:** The hike can be muddy, so proper footwear is essential. Consider hiring a local guide from Isnos to enrich your experience with knowledge about local flora and fauna.

## 4. Betania Reservoir: Freshwater Playground

This massive reservoir, created by damming the Magdalena River, has evolved into a paradise for water sports enthusiasts. Locals flock here for swimming, kayaking, water skiing, and sailing, yet international tourists rarely make it to these shores. The reservoir's shores are dotted with small restaurants serving fresh fish dishes, and several viewpoints offer panoramic vistas of this vast body of water surrounded by mountains.

**Local tip:** Visit the southern shore for the best swimming spots with clearer water and fewer motorboats.

## 5. Cacao Farms of Gigante

The small town of Gigante has emerged as a center for premium cacao production. Several family farms have opened their doors to visitors, offering immersive tours that showcase the journey from bean to chocolate. Unlike large commercial operations, these intimate tours often include hands-on experiences harvesting cacao pods, fermenting beans, and even making your own chocolate using traditional methods.

**Local tip:** Make sure to try "chocolate santafereño," a local hot chocolate preparation served with fresh cheese—a delicious sweet and savory combination!

## 6. Obando Archaeological Site

While San Agustín gets all the glory, the smaller and quieter archaeological site of Obando offers a more intimate experience with pre-Columbian statuary. Located between San Agustín and Pitalito, this site features distinctive stone carvings in a peaceful setting with few visitors. The on-site museum houses unique artifacts not found in San Agustín, providing a complementary experience to the more famous park.

**Local tip:** Visit in the late afternoon when the light is perfect for photography and you might have the entire site to yourself.

## 7. Parque Natural Regional Corredor Biológico Guácharos-Puracé

This protected corridor connecting two national parks is a paradise for experienced hikers and wildlife enthusiasts. The trail system traverses multiple ecosystems, from cloud forests to high-altitude páramo, and is home to rare species like the spectacled bear and mountain tapir. Multi-day treks with local guides offer an authentic wilderness experience far from tourist crowds.

**Local tip:** The town of Palestina serves as an excellent gateway to the park and has basic accommodations for trekkers.

## 8. La Plata's Silver Mines

The town of La Plata (literally "Silver") was named for the silver mines that attracted Spanish colonizers. Today, visitors can explore some of these historic mines with local guides who explain the area's rich mining heritage. The surrounding landscape of rolling hills and coffee plantations adds to the charm of this authentic Colombian town.

**Local tip:** The local museum houses an impressive collection of pre-Columbian artifacts discovered near the mines, evidence of the region's long history of human habitation.

## 9. Paicol's Colonial Architecture

This beautifully preserved colonial town features whitewashed buildings with colorful trim, flower-filled balconies, and cobblestone streets that have changed little since the 18th century. Unlike more famous colonial towns like Villa de Leyva or Barichara, Paicol sees relatively few tourists, allowing for a more authentic experience of daily life in a historic Colombian settlement. The town's church and central plaza are particularly photogenic, especially in the early morning light.

**Local tip:** Time your visit to coincide with the town's patron saint festival in August for traditional music, dance, and cuisine.

## 10. Quebrada El Tambillo Rock Art

Just outside the town of Campoalegre lies one of Colombia's most significant yet least visited rock art sites. The ravine walls of Quebrada El Tambillo feature dozens of pre-Columbian petroglyphs depicting human figures, animals, and abstract symbols. Archaeologists believe these carvings date back at least 3,000 years, offering a fascinating glimpse into the region's ancient civilizations.

**Local tip:** Visit with a knowledgeable local guide who can help you spot the more subtle carvings and explain their possible meanings.

## When to Visit Huila's Hidden Gems

The best time to explore these off-the-beaten-path locations is during the dry seasons from December to February and June to August. The shoulder seasons (March-April and September-October) can also be good, with fewer visitors and occasional rain showers that bring out the lush greens of the landscape. Many of these sites are accessible year-round, but some of the more remote areas like the Biological Corridor can become challenging during heavy rains.

## Getting Around

While public transportation reaches many of these destinations, renting a car or hiring a driver gives you much more flexibility to explore these hidden corners of Huila. Alternatively, several local tour operators in Neiva and San Agustín are beginning to offer customized itineraries to these lesser-known attractions.

## Final Thoughts

Huila's true magic lies in these overlooked treasures that offer authentic connections with the land, people, and history of this remarkable region. By venturing beyond the department's famous attractions, you'll be rewarded with unique experiences and memories that few international travelers can claim. As tourism in Colombia continues to grow, these hidden gems may not remain secret for long—now is the perfect time to discover the heart of Huila before the rest of the world catches on.
